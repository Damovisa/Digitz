# Introduction to Deep Learning
* Machine Learning is Different
    * h(x)
    * questions machine learning can answer
    * process
* Building these things
    * features to vectors
    * mathematical representation
        * model
        * cost/reward function
    * optimizing the things
        * gradients
* Recognizing digits
    * Graph
        * IN: Constants, Placeholders, Variables
        * OUT: Session params
    * Run
* linear model
    * model + cost function
    * tensorflow example
* multi-layer linear model (MLP)
    * model + cost function
    * tensorflow example
* better architecture
    * convolutional neural network
    * tensorflow example
